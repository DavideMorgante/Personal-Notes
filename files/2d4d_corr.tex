and compactified either on the first factor or on the second one. In the partition function of the $6d$ theory is a nice SUSY partition function that does not depende on the sizes of the two factors, then we expect the lower dimentional partition functions to match. Pictorially

\section{\texorpdfstring{$2d$ Yang-Mills}{2dYM}}
In $2d$ there is no physical propagating degrees of freedom. Take $G$ to be a non-abelian Lie group. The action is of the form
\begin{equation}
	S\propto=\frac{1}{e^2}\int \dd[2]{x}\sqrt{\det g}\Tr F^2
\end{equation}
In $2d$ the only non-zero component of the curvature tensor is $F_{01}$ therefore
\begin{equation}
	\Tr F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}=(g^{00}g^{11}-g^{01}g^{10})\Tr F_{01}^2=\det g^{-1}\Tr F_{01}^2
\end{equation}
so that 
\begin{equation}
	S \propto\frac{1}{e^2}\int\dd[2]{x}\sqrt{\det g}^{-1}\Tr F_{01}^2
\end{equation}
Therefore, the action only depends on the area of the surface, there is no additional dependence on the metric. This is a very special kind of $2d$ QFT. Whenever such a QFT is also a CFT, the theory is a $2d$ TQFT. The dependence on the coupling can be reabsorbed in the definition of the area.

We can solve this theory in many ways, but let us consider the Hamiltonian formalism putting the theory on cylinder. 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[transform shape]
		\pic[
			tqft/cylinder, 
			rotate=90,
			fill=blue!50,

		];
		\draw[overlay,
				shift=(a-outgoing boundary), 
				xscale=.5,
				decoration={markings, mark=at position 0.8 with {\arrow{>}}}, 
				postaction={decorate}] {(1.5,0)} circle (.7) node[above left,yshift= 10pt, xshift=-15pt, thick] {};
		\draw[<->, thick, transform canvas={yshift=-1cm}] (a-incoming boundary.north) --node[below] {$T$}  (a-outgoing boundary.south) ;
		\node (L) at (5.3,0.7) {$L$};
		\draw[->, thick, transform canvas={xshift=.3cm,yshift=.2cm}] (a-incoming boundary) to [out=180,in=90] (-2,-1) node[below] {$\cH_{S^1}$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}\\

On $S^1$ we have an Hilbert space of states which, by taking the length of the circle to be $L$ can be defined as follows
\begin{equation}
	G\ni U=\text{Pexp}\int_0^L A_1 \dd x^1
\end{equation}
which is almost gauge invariant. At $0$ we still have a residual gauge transformation
\begin{equation}
	U\to gUg^-1
\end{equation}
So the Hilbert space is spanned by wavefunctions of $U$ which are invariant under the residual gauge transformation 
\begin{equation}
	\cH_{S^1}\ni \Psi(U)=\Psi(gUG^-1)
\end{equation}
One such basis for this Hilbert space is given by the characters of the representation $\chi_R(U)=\Tr_R U$ (class functions) which are indeed invariant under adjoint action. Moreover these are orthogonal given the following inner product
\begin{equation}
	\int \chi_R(U)\overline{\chi_{R^\prime}(U)}\dd{[U]}_{\text{Haar}}=\delta_{RR^\prime}
\end{equation}
Using the standard canonical quantization procedure, we can also find the Hamiltonian of the system. Being the only non-zero component of the curvature $F_{01}=E$, we have no magnetic field and therefore 
\begin{equation}
	H=\int_0^L\abs{E}^2\dd{x^1}=\int_0^L\frac{\delta}{\delta A_1(x_1)}\frac{\delta}{\delta A_1(x_1)}
\end{equation}
The action of the Hamiltonian on the basis is easily computed
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	H \chi_R(U) &= H \Tr_R\text{Pexp}\int_0^L T^a A_1^a\dd{x^1}\\
	&=\Tr_R\qty(\int_0^L T^a T^a) \dd{x^1}\Tr_R\text{Pexp}\int_0^L T^a A_1^a\dd{x^1}\\
	&=L c_2(R) \chi_R(U)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which proves that the characters are indeed eigenstates of the hamiltonian. We can further idenfity the sides of the cylinder to get a torus $\bbT^2=S^1\times S^1$ and compute the partition function 
\begin{equation}
	Z_{2d}=\Tr_{\cH_{S^1}}e^{-HT}=\sum_R e^{-TL c_2(R)}
\end{equation}
which only depends on the area $TL$.

Next step, let us consider the following geometry: a disk with area $A$ (a cigar) 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{tikzpicture}[transform shape]
		\pic[
			tqft/cap,
			rotate=-90,
			scale=2,
			fill=blue!50,
			opacity=.5,
			cobordism edge/.style={draw},
			every outgoing boundary component/.style={draw},
			name=a
		];
		\draw[->, thick] (-3.3,0) -- (-2,0) node[right] {$A$};
		\draw[->, thick, transform canvas={yshift=-.6cm, xshift=-.4cm}] (a-outgoing boundary) to[in=90,out=90] (-5,-.4) node[below] {$\cH_{S^1}\ni\Psi_A(U)$};
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{equation}\\
where now
\begin{equation}
	\cH_{S^1}\ni \Psi_A(U)
\end{equation}
which we like to determine (Hartle-Hawking wavefunction). To determine it we can consider joining a cylinder with area $A^\prime$ to the cigar and get\\

\begin{minipage}[c]{0.4\textwidth}

		\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={(0,-.2)}, transform shape]
			\pic[
				tqft/cap,
				scale=1.5,
				fill=blue!50,
				opacity=.5,
				cobordism edge/.style={draw},
				every outgoing boundary component/.style={fill=blue!50},
				name=h,
				rotate=90
			];
			\pic[
				tqft/cylinder, 
				fill=blue!50,
				scale=1.5,
				at=(h-outgoing boundary 1),
				opacity=.5,
				cobordism edge/.style={draw},

			];
		\end{tikzpicture}
	\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.55\textwidth}
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_{A+A^\prime}(U)=e^{-A^\prime H}\Psi_A(U)
\end{equation}
\end{minipage}\\[10pt]
since we can easily change the area it is sufficient to know the zero area wavefunction. This can be understood from a path integral point of view. We have our spacetime to which there is cut out a zero-area disk. The holonomy around it needs to be one. Therefore the zero-area limit of this wavefunction must be a delta function. This is not square-integrable but we just add a constant
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_A(U)=\alpha\delta(U)=\sum_R f_R\chi_R(U)
\end{equation}
where the constants can be found as
\begin{equation}
	\alpha\chi_{R^\prime}(1)=f_{R^\prime}
\end{equation}
so that $f_R=\alpha \dim R$. Let us consider the pair of pants geometry with area $A$ so that we have three Hilbert spaces which should determine a vector in 
\begin{equation}
	\bigotimes_{i=1,2,3} H_{S^1}\ni \Psi_A(U_1,U_2,U_3)
\end{equation}
depending on the three holonomies.

By gluing a disk to one of the $S^1$ we get a cylinder with area $A+A^\prime$ to which we know the wavefunction. Therefore 
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_A(U_1,U_2,U_3)=\sum_R e^{-A c_2(R)}\frac{\chi_R(U_1)\chi_R(U_2)\chi_R(U_3)}{\dim R}
\end{equation}
We can now glue the three-punctured spheres in various ways to get many different geometries with different genus. For example, for genus $g=1$ with three punctures $n=3$ we can find 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{\alpha^{2g-2+n}}\sum_R e^{-A c_2(R)}\frac{\prod_i \chi_R(U_i)}{(\dim R)^{2g-2+n}}
\end{equation}
Originally the constant $alpha$ came from the fact that the zero-area disk amplitude is a delta function which has to be normalized. On a genus $g$ surface, doing a QFT is very easy to generate a counterterm of the form 
\begin{equation}
	\delta S=\beta\int \dd[2]{x}\sqrt{g}R=\beta (2-2g)
\end{equation}
on a closed Riemann surface. This multiplies $Z$ by 
\begin{equation}
	e^{\beta(2-2g)}
\end{equation}
and the boundaries give some similar quantities depending on $n$. 

\section{$q$-deformed YM}
We consider the gauge group $G$ to be a standard Lie group. We deform it to a quantum group $G_q$ (the matrix entries become non-commutative). Take for example $\SU(2)_q$
\begin{equation}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\alpha&\beta\\
		-\beta^*&\alpha^*
	\end{pmatrix},\qquad \alpha\beta=q\;\beta\alpha,\; \alpha\beta^*=q\;\beta^*\alpha,\ldots
\end{equation}
So we try to define a $2d$ YM in a lattice formulation for example, where all the link variables are replaced by a quantum group element instead of Lie group elements. This can be done in any dimensions but because of the non-commutativity one needs to define exacly in which order each link variable appears in the path integral. This is known at least in two dimensions how to do it consistently. In general dimensions is not known\dots

The end result is simple actually. Just replice the dimension of the rep by it's quantum dimension. When $G=\SU(N)_q$, then 
\begin{equation}
	\dim_q R = \chi_R\qty(\text{diag}(q^{\frac{N-1}{2}},q^{\frac{N-3}{2}},\cdots,q^{\frac{1-N}{2}})) 
\end{equation}
which in the limit $q\rightarrow1$ becomes $\chi_R(1)=\dim R$ as expected.

\section{Relation between Gaiotto theories and $q$-deformed YM}
Consider the superconformal index of $\cN=2$ $\SU(2)$ with $N_f=4$ flavours. This theory enjoys a special kind of S-duality discussed before. 

The relevant step in recongnizing the relationship between this theory and the $q$-deformed YM theory, is to consider the SCI of the Gaiotto theory in the limit of $q=t$. Consider in fact the half hypermultiplet contribution to the index 
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma(t^{1/2}z^\pm a^\pm b^\pm;p,q)\Gamma(t^{1/2}z^\pm c^\pm d^\pm;p,q)
\end{equation}
which explicitly, with $q=t$, gives
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma(t^{1/2}z^\pm;p,q)=\prod_{m,n\ge 0}\frac{1-z^{-1}p^{m+1}q^{n+\frac{1}{2}}}{1-zp^m q^{n+\frac{1}{2}}}\frac{1-z p^{m+1}q^{n+\frac{1}{2}}}{1-z^{-1}p^m q^{n+\frac{1}{2}}}
\end{equation}
There is a quasi complete cancellation between numerator and denominator such that the whole product just becomes
\begin{equation}
	\prod_{n\ge0}\frac{1}{1-q^{n+\frac{1}{2}}z}\frac{1}{1-q^{n+\frac{1}{2}}z^{-1}}
\end{equation}
and the dependence on $p$ vanished (this is a general behavior for $\cN=2$ SCFTs). This is due to the enanchement of SUSY in the aformentioned limit. 

So for the SCI of the original Gaiotto theory becomes 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{2}\oint \frac{\dd z}{2\pi \I z}(1-z^2)(1-z^{-2})K(z)^{-2}\prod_{\pm\pm\pm}\prod_{n\ge 0}\frac{1}{1-q^{n+\frac{1}{2}}z^\pm a^\pm b^\pm}\frac{1}{1-q^{n+\frac{1}{2}}z^\pm c^\pm d^\pm}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	K(z)^{-1}=\prod_{n\ge 0}(1-q^{n+1})\prod_\pm (1-q^{n+1}z^{\pm 2})
\end{equation}
The matter contribution can be rewritten with an infinite sum insted of an infinite product
\begin{equation}
	\prod_{\pm\pm\pm}\prod_{n\ge0}\frac{1}{1-q^{+\frac{1}{2}}z^\pm a^\pm b^\pm}=\frac{K(z)K(a)K(b)}{K_0}\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{\chi_n(z)\chi_n(a)\chi_n(b)}{\chi_n(q^{\frac{1}{2}})}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	\chi_n(a)=a^{n-1}+a^{n-3}+\cdots+a^{1-n}
\end{equation}
which is the character of 
\begin{equation}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		a&0\\
		0&a^{-1}
	\end{pmatrix}\in \SU(2)
\end{equation}
in the $n$-dimensional rep of $\SU(2)$, and
\begin{equation}
	K_0^{-1}=\prod_{n\ge0}(1-q^{2+n})
\end{equation}

We can plug this in the SCI formula and find
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\frac{1}{2}\oint &\frac{\dd{z}}{2\pi \I z}(1-z^2)(1-z^{-2})K(z)^{-2}\frac{K(z)K(a)K(b)}{K_0}\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{\chi_n(z)\chi_n(a)\chi_n(b)}{\chi_n(q^{\frac{1}{2}})}\\
	&\times\frac{K(z)K(c)K(d)}{K_0}\sum_{m\ge 1}\frac{\chi_m(z)\chi_m(c)\chi_m(d)}{\chi_m(q^{\frac{1}{2}})}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
The dependence on $z$ is localized now. Now $K(z)$ cancels out and the only $z$ dependent factors are in the charachers. There is a formula 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{2}\oint \frac{\dd{z}}{2\pi \I z}(1-z^2)(1-z^{-2})\chi_m(z)\chi_n(z)=\delta_{m,n}
\end{equation}
since this is the orthogonal condition of the character on the torus of $\SU(2)$. Therefore the final result simplyfies a lot
\begin{equation}
	\frac{K(a)K(b)K(c)K(d)}{K_0^2}\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{\chi_n(a)\chi_n(b)\chi_n(c)\chi_n(d)}{\chi_n(q^{\frac{1}{2}})^2}
\end{equation}
And now the invariance under the exchange of the various letters is manifest! But this is also just the partition function of $q$-deformed YM on a four punctured sphere with holonomies $a,b,c,d$ with the area sent to zero\\[10pt]

This is the explicit $4d-2d$ correspondance! 

\section{\texorpdfstring{Connection to $6d$}{M-theory}}
But why is this the case? The general idea is that each half-hypermultiplet corresponds to a three-punctured sphere and the gauge field is just a tube connecting punctures. 

The fact is that there is a certain $6d$ $\cN=(2,0)$ SCFT labelled by $G=ADE$\footnote{$A_n=\SU(n+1),D_n=\SO(2n),E_n=E_6,E_7,E_8$} such that its compactification on $S^1$ in the IR is given by a $5d$ $\cN=2$ SYM with gauge group $G$. By compactifying the $A_n$ case on the right punctured geometry the $4d$ theory is just the one studyied up to now.

But how do we know this? Starting from string theory, consider $N$ M5-branes on top of each other. The worldsheet theory is just the $6d$ $\cN=(2,0)$ gauge theory with gauge group $A_{N-1}$. For $D_N,E_N$ one can do similar constructions.
